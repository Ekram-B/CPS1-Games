# CPS1-Games
A Repository of Games written in Assembly for a CPS1 Emulator

The source code found in this repository was created for the purpose of emulating how users of a CPS1 Microcontroller would have played games. The CPS1 computer was designed by MIL (Microsystems International Limited) in the 1970's. As per the directive of Prof. Zbigniew Stackniak (York University), students under his guidance recreated games using the Native assmebly language of the computer. Games were created by students: Andrew Lau (Bsc. Comp Sci Candidate), Catherine Yan (Bsc. Comp Sci Candidate), Ekram Bhuiyan (B.eng Candidate) and Jeffrey Young (Bsc. Comp Sci Candidate). Source written by students were passed into the emulator and a player was able to simulate playing games on the Emulator with the Keyboard.

Tester7.2.txt is source code written in the native assembly of CPS1 for an original primitive shooter. Bagles.txt is source code written as a reimplementation of the popular game "Bagles". Usernum.txt are entries to be passed into the "Bagles" game as input.
